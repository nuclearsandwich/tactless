It is really hard to manually\r\nenter a large number of entries and the text file format neither natural nor\r\nstandard. I don't think tactless is better than abook, but it does the tasks I\r\nhave at hand in a way that fits in my workflow better... or at least it will as\r\nI continue to hack on it.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstall it as a gem:\r\n\r\n  $ gem install tactless\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou should now have a binary called `tactless` on your path. Start off by adding\r\na contact.\r\n\r\n- `tactless add`: This will open a vim window (yes, Vim, hardcoded for now)\r\nwhere you can enter a yaml representation of your new contact. Let's add\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Steven! Ragnar√∂k\r\nemail: steven@nuclearsandwich.com\r\naliases:\r\n- steven!\r\ntags:\r\n- \\m/\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `tactless browse`: Opens vim with the entire contacts database. In the future\r\nthis may open the file read only.\r\n\r\n- `tactless mutt ALIAS`: Prints out a mutt query for the given alias with name,\r\nemail, and tags.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIt's a standalone tool. So I'll license it under GPLv3 when I can be arsed to\r\nlicense it.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n6. Get a high five.\r\n\r\n[Abook]: http://abook.sourceforge.net/\r\n"}
